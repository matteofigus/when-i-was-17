when-i-was-17
============

When I was 17 I was quite into PHP and I open-sourced some dozens of PHP scripts, mainly UI components or little utilities. 

They obviously got lost in the internet, but I decided I'm gonna put them here when I find them, so that I can collect them.

When I feel sad and I want to smile, I can see how horrible this code was and still how many hundreds of people wrote me during this years thanking me because they solved some problems because of them.

Also, a gently reminder to me that:
* 15 years ago writing modular and re-usable code was already cool
* don't aim for perfection when doing open-source: just do it
* when using OSS, try to say thank you to the maintainer when it solves a problem for you
